Summary:

  This submission contains the files:

    more03.c    -- my solution to the project
    termfuncs.c -- course provided functions
    termfuncs.h -- header file for termfuncs
    Makefile    -- the makefile
    Plan        -- a description of the design and operation of my code
    typescript  -- a sample run

Notes:

I changed the return type of print_one_line from void to int to handle the case where
one row exceeded the number of columns in the terminal. This way, if a given line printed
across 2+ rows, it could return how much space was gobbled up to accurately update the
"space_left" variable.

When calling get_term_size(), I put it in a very simple if condition that printed any
errors to stderr and did nothing else. It appears twice -- I know it is redundant but
figured a separate function was not necessary and even more redundant. I would be curious
what best-practice would be for how to handle an error. Should the program exit and stop
running? Is there a concise way to call get_term_size() and check the error other than
how I did so? My idea for factoring it out into a function would be a void check_term()
function that works the same as the code as written. Would make each call one line, but
I am not sure if that is factoring it out too far. Thoughts/advice would be welcome.
