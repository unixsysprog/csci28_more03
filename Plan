-----------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:

The purpose of more03 is to extend the 'more02' version of more
by adding new features:

   [a] no need to press Enter to have program receive a keystroke
   [b] program will work in any size terminal window
   [c] program will work if window is resized when program is running

Outline:

The program still has a main loop that reads the command line and processes
files named there.  If no files are named on the command line, the program
pages through data read from stdin.

For each file, the program shows one screenful of lines, then asks the user
what to do, reads a keystroke from the user.  Depending on the key pressed,
the program quits, shows one more line of text, or shows one more screenful
of text, then asks again.

When outputting screenful, the program checks the terminal size to display the
correct number of rows, both on the first run, and any successive prompt by the
user. This is done through a call to get_term_size(), storing the result in an
int array "rows_cols". If more data is to be printed, the line containing "More?"
is cleared, the cursor is reset, and the loop runs until there is no more space left.

Layering:

	main ,for each file, calls:
		do_more	-- which pages through a file calling
			how_much_more -- to ask user how much more to show, gets term size each call

File Structure:

	more03.c	-- the main three functions listed above
	termfuncs.c	-- a toolkit that provides access to terminal info and input
